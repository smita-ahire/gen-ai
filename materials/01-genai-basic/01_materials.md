## DIAL API Integration with Microsoft Semantic Kernel
 - Overview: The DIAL API provides a universal interface for interacting with various LLMs (self-hosted or from providers like Azure, Google, or vLLM). It mirrors the Azure OpenAI API, enabling the use of Azure abstractions in frameworks like Microsoft Semantic Kernel (SK).
 - Key Role: DIAL acts as a host or proxy for LLMs, simplifying integration and allowing frameworks like SK to streamline business logic around LLM calls efficiently.
